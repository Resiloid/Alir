       Orphans, left with nothing, but a feigning hope for the future and abandoned promises of the Asteri are a lifeblood of the 
       shady experiments ran by the government of that dominion. After all, those who have nothing, are perfect cogs for the 
       more intricate parts of the Dominions war machine. Assassins, spies, saboteurs and monsters. <br>
      One of them was Roxie, and with an encroaching shadow threatening to overtake h√≠s person, he set out to wander the world in 
      search of a cure, as a benevolent nomad 
       trying to help as best he can where he can.

         1) Shadow of the Self </a> </strong><br>
       
         All people have a shadow of their mind, a place where dark desires and fantasies of violence reside, a place where 
         nightmares of ones own creation bide their time, be it of impotence or restraint of the person. <br>
         In Roxie's case this took a more literal form, as his emotions ever elevated within broke though in torrents of 
         carnage. Lacking understanding, young man sought to control this power, becoming more and more reserved as time went on.
         However containing such might is not a matter of how, but when... When will it break through the walls put before it to indiscriminately
          wreak havoc.  <br>
          Upon breaking through this power takes over and a new creature emerges, one of malice and spite.
           Its body is liquid shadow, its claws - absolute dark and its maw - a black hole. <br>
        Restraint is a virtue, but when Roxie releases this beast foes cover before him, 
        as the darker sides mania purges all who stand in the way of the young wizard. Will control prevail, or will the shadow consume the self? Remains to be seen...
