 sending a large portion of your blood to the Sire. You reduce both current an maximum HP and add that 
 number to the damage of the attack.

  Tier 4: Long forgotten power </summary> 
  Alarik, do you feel this? My blood coursing through your veins. The burning sensation enveloping your 
  very being, pain that never seizes, rage never to be quenched, and service never fulfilled. With these 
  few droplets you will become one of my court, protected by my grace. Now, drink, become whole 
  again....<br>
  Alarik’s mind darkens for a fleeting moment, but for that moment he feels fearless again. Scars of a
  soldier closed, alongside the wounds of body. But the piece dissipated, leaving behind phantoms of the 
  past, now distant... like dreams. Why, were you always bound to war? Why can you never be content
  without agony, both given and taken? <br>
  You reject MY gift? No, this isn’t right...<br>
  Sire with a swift lunge grabbed Alarik, lifting him like a weightless doll. 
  You are not normal... A beast by birth, inherent... immortality. <br>
  For a second, eyes of the Sire, coloured with artificial compassion lit up in curiosity. <br>
  Listen to it once, for it wont be repeated. You have just sped up my plans by a millennia, and for that, 
  you will have my gratitude. I will make you my attack dog, a creature more dangerous than any sired by 
  ME. A living weapon, an echo of old. Now drink, become whole again.<br>
  Sire forced Alarik on his knees, beneath him. With a black dagger, he slashed his wrist, dark, viscous 
  blood flowing onto the soldier’s face, at first young Human desired to resist, but the texture awakened 
  something primordial within him. As Alarik opened his mouth, he let a few droplets in, embracing the 
  euphoric sensation, as more and more flowed into him, satiating the inherent thirst. <br>
  Like a king standing above a knighted crusader Sire smirked, his pale face painted with a grimace of 
  delight. <br>
  -A man no more, for a beast is what you will always be!

      Your own veins, overflown with my essence. </summary> 
      If you are bleeding, or if you use a bonus action to cut your wrist and take 1d6 slashing damage you can 
      decide to drink your own blood, feeding the slumbering savage sickness. Upon doing that, you gain all 
      the features of a lvl 20 barbarian, temporary HP equal to 50+ 5 times the max HP you have missing, all 
      the damage you deal is doubled and ignores resistances, you lose all the exhaustion points you have and 
      at the start of your turn you gain 1 point of exhaustion, without incurring any penalties from those. 
      Once you gain 5 points of exhaustion, you lose all the benefits, and immediately go into a dying state, 
      unable to be healed for more than 1 HP. If you use this ability more than once per week, you have an 
      75% chance to lose yourself to the beast forever.
