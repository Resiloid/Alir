          Living weapons are a finicky tool. Unless utterly broken, which in of itself brings a bit of challenges, they 
          are unreliable. The solution that Lord Ilray discovered, is to break the weakest part of consciousness, 
          splitting the ruins from the still formed being, triggering that state at a directive allowing full control of 
          the weapons actions if required. Although these states are yet imperfect, and utterlu incomprehensive 
          of their actions, and thus utterly non-adaptable. Although this one... might be a breakthrough. <br>
          Necessary discrepancy advised. This one is the direct form of access to the latent resources of the body, 
          effectively removing inhibitions, both bodily and those of morality.
