     </summary> 
     -Have you ever pondered, why we drink blood? Why we can only satiate ourselves with a liquid that flows to sustain others? <br>
     The gentle caress graced the shoulder of a kneeling young man, his red hair almost defiantly flowing behind him, making it seem
      like man was engulfed in a blaze. <br>
     A tall and slender figure dressed in the finest tailored clothing in the realms, adorned with the centrepiece of 
     its wardrobe – a scarf of flowing red silk kneeled down, almost to the eye level with the man.  <br>
     -We desire power, you coming to me confirmed such. And the taste of it is what we crave, we are addicted to it. <br>
     The Vampire lifted the face of the man with his long well-groomed fingers, his grip gentle, yet firm around his cheeks.
      The man saw the eyes in front of him. Eyes of crimson. Eyes of influence. Eyes of an eternity. <br>
     -The moment the first droplet of my Sire’s blood dripped onto my tongue I felt more alive than ever. <br>
     The vampire’s grip grew stronger as the reminiscence invoked deep seeded power, carefully restrained before. 
     The nails of the monster sank into the mans skin, a small red stream now running down his cheek. <br>
     -It is the pleasure that rips apart your self, from the giblets of it emerging the true you.  But, lets refrain from sermons.
      After all, this isn’t why you are here...<br>
     The slender vampire stood up holding his wrist above the face of the man, exposed, dark blood pulsing in the pale veins. <br>
     -I just need to hear the word.<br>
     In anticipation, the kneeling man looked up at his future master, with eyes consumed by thirst. <br>
     -Yes! <br>
     With that word uttered, the vampire unsheathed an ornate dagger and slashed his own wrist. The crimson liquid flowed down like a river of power. 
     As the first droplet touched the mans face, it burned like molten steel, 
     staining the pale visage with sinful redness. The man has opened his mouth, letting the flow in. <br>
     -You are born again... Alizara.<br><br>
     
     Your awakening has given you a new perspective on existence, although centuries of lavish opulence have numbed your senses somewhat. 
     There are protocols for the sons of the Sire when engaging in mortal affairs and even when fighting them. You, despite your defection, have still carried yourself around, with the nobility worthy of a count.
