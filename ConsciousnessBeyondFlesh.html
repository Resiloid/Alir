                      Your intellect expands beyond your own perception. You start experiencing things beyond yourself. Your 
                      mind sometimes wanders outside of thought, tethering itself to the nearest flight of fancy. Mind for you 
                      becomes a sixths sense of the body. This is all but a start to the journey however.

                   Mind tethered </summary> 
                  As an action you can tether yourself to a willing creature, sharing everything from surface thought to 
                  skills and abilities. The tether persists while you are within 500 feet of each other. You can make actions 
                  using spells, features and class abilities of each other. You use your own stats for everything except spell 
                  attacks and saves, which are kept from the original owner of the ability/spell. After you use this feature 
                  once, you cant use it again until you finish a long rest.

                   Wandering mind, never a tame beast </summary> 
                  As a consequence of your minds expansion and lack of identity, concentrating becomes a progressively 
              more daunting task for you. You have disadvantage on concentration checks, but whenever your 
                concentration is broken you restore a reaction, and can use it immediately to cast a cantrip, psionic 
                talent or a single attack.
