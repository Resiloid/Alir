     </summary> 
     There is nothing... nothing... nothing... <br>
     The red haired man wakes up in cold sweat on his bed of hay inside a cheap inn next to the cordon of the Spires. <br>
     Visions of slaughter and him laughing manically as the bodies drop around him. All of them will die, all of them will pay for the injustices <br>
     they commit, and out of the bloody fog he alone will emerge, a benevolent ruler, a god who the meek will herd towards in search of salvation.<br>
      A god who the cruel will fear, for drawing his ire is a sign of sure demise. Him! Him! Him! <br>
     Roxie stands up, his hands shaking still in a bout of mercurial despair.<br>
      He sees his silhouette splitting, as if there is something attempting to emerge from his skin. <br>
     With considerable effort, he pushes the urge down, deep into the shackles he has built around it, <br>
     that strangle both beast and man. <br>
     As the tremors subside, Roxie walks to the window, looking at the edge of the world. <br>
     Soon he will be far from here, far from the shame of his past.

                At the start of every turn, 
                Roxie rolls a Wisdom saving throw against a DC of 1 (this ability is excluded from the nat 1 rules,
                 and you cant purposely fail it), if he fails, he unleashes something, simply referred to as Revengeance (stats listed below).<br>
                  The DC is increased by 1 per every saving throw failed, damage equal to your character level taken or dealt, fails on saving throws 
                  against your spells and/or abilities and any loss of control effects applied (aka grappled, restrain, incapacitated, charmed,
                   frightened, paralyzed, stunned). <br>Upon unleashing the Revengeance the can stay in this state for up to 1 minute.

                     Once the Revengence has been freed, it is docile for the next day, and will not force Roxie to make saving throws. 
                     The saving throw is reset to 1.

       You can now take pieces of Revengeance and grant them temporary consciousness.<br>
        As a bonus action, you may choose to summon a fragment of Revengeance and immediately use one of its abilities.<br>
         Doing this will force you to spend either your action, or your bonus action on using one of its abilities.
          (Its abilities are those of Revengeance, but the damage is divided by two and rounded down. 
          And spells are limited to those equal to your proficiency score or less)
          On subsequent turns you can use the Bonus Action or an Action to give out orders to the fragments.  <br><br>
       If you donâ€™t satiate its eagerness it will drain you at the end of your turn reducing your 
       max HP by 1d10+your level until the next long rest and dissipating. 
       Dismissing the fragment requires an action.

            Within you reside the creatures spawned by the anti-creation maddened by nonexistence. 
            By invoking them as an action you can create a gravitational field around you, speeding up every 
            creature coming towards you by two times your level, and slowing those going further away, or vice versa. 
            This ability lasts for 1 minute and requires concentration.
