     </summary> 
     There is nothing... nothing... nothing... <br>
     The red haired man wakes up in cold sweat on his bed of hay inside a cheap inn next to the cordon of the Spires. <br>
     Visions of slaughter and him laughing manically as the bodies drop around him. All of them will die, all of them will pay for the injustices <br>
     they commit, and out of the bloody fog he alone will emerge, a benevolent ruler, a god who the meek will her towards in search of salvation.<br>
      A god who the cruel will fear, for drawing his ire is a sign of sure demise. Him! Him! Him! <br>
     Roxxie stands up, his hands shaking still in a bout of mercurial despair.<br>
      He sees his silhouette splitting, as if there is something attempting to emerge from his skin. <br>
     With considerable effort, he pushes the urge down, deep into the shackles he has built around it, <br>
     that strangle both beast and man. <br>
     As the tremors subside, Roxxie walks to the window, looking at the edge of the world. <br>
     Soon he will be far from here, far from the shame of his past.
