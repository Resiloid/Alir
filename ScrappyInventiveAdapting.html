        <p class="KalistaAbilities">Kalisto’s gift of quick wit and a quicker grasp of concepts grants her an ability to understand and 
            implement most research in creative ways. All around the world she can research techniques (usually by 
            getting a hold onto a piece of pristine craftsmanship to reverse engineer, or by acquiring research 
            document pertaining to the field, and those that are useful to the craft.) 
            There are two types or techniques – minor and major. Minor teach a small ability with a nonexistent 
            progression paths. Major are built through extensive research, and improve akin to the character 
            systems. 
            To learn a technique, you need to spend at least 2d10 hours researching a minor ability or 4d10 hours 
            researching major abilities (rolling these at the time of acquisition). 
            To craft these , you need to use special materials on top of the regular materials.
            Major techniques have a predetermined failure rate of crafting. Wasting the material, and failing the 
            craft.  </p>

        <p class="KalistaAbilities">Your gun is a tinkering marvel, but its far from perfect. For now it can be scoped as a bonus action, to 
            gain 30 bonus range and double the damage of it. After scoping, reloading the chamber takes a longer 
            time, forcing you to reload it as a bonus action until you can use your gun again.  </p>

        </summary>
        <p class="KalistaAbilities">Every time you come upon scrap, you can scavenge it for useful parts. Roll a 1d12 a number of times 
            chosen by the DM to gain materials to use for the techniques of “Fast learner, Faster adjuster, big 
            earner”. These can be also purchased from merchants, but at an exorbitant price. Some techniques will 
            require special materials not obtainable through scavenging. These would need to be obtained in the 
            world.</p>

      Hrothir Gigafunk a master like no other, banished for his controversial practices, is one of the worlds most renowned thinkers. 
      The one who gets even a glimpse of his research, is in for a world of knowledge. <br>
      .............................................................<br>
        The research papers in the ambassadors mansion, added to the reverse engineering of the devices of 
      the back of the necks of Halflings has let you to a rudimentary understanding of Gigafunks genius.<br>
      .............................................................<br>
      The documents snatched by Kalista from the bowels of the Colossus describe a collaboration between 
     someone named Spencer Multiny-Serionov and Esteemed Hrothir Gigafunk on several projects, which are alltogether classified as
      the Prelude to the calamity. <br>
1)The twelve mountains<br>
2)The Supreme Supreme Gigapawns<br>
3)The Realm Breaker<br>
4)The Biggest Funk <br>
5)The Own Artifice (this one seems to be the most important one as it is underlined in red ink)<br>
Aside from the projects, there stand the rudimentary parts of the advanced protection suits of the Zeraxion engineers.

      You can attach a body enhancer to the targeted living creature, granting it a a bonus to a physical stat of 
      your choice permanently. Attaching more than one, will most likely result in the body overloading and 
      permanent harm.<br>

          You can create suits that protect from certain types of damage. While wearing the suits, your movement speed is reduced by 10 and you gain resistance to a certain damage type for until the suit has absorbed a total of 100 damage upon which all of the materials wear off. 
          It seems that all types of suits require Isolating Paint (8), but depending on the damage, other ingredients vary. <br>
          Fire Resistant – Something to regulate heat (4)<br>
          Cold Resistant – Burners(11) <br>

      The manual is a basic manual to the Zeraxion factory workers of its war machine. While a lot of the pages are unreadable, 
      some are, and the technology is inspjring even for an educated citizen of the Enlighted City. 
      Another thing mentioned, that those weapons of war are much more potent if infused with black steel of high quality. <br>

For each of these you need (11) Burners.
 On use as an action creates an explosion in a 15 foot radius, forcing all targets within to make a Dex save against the creators spell save DC.
  On fail the targets take 14d8 points of Fire Damage.
If infused with Black steel the damage and radius are trippled, it deals half damage on a successful save, and its damage type changes to force damage. </p></details>
