        The past of this shape-shifting assassin is shrouded in an enigma. His actions at times defy common sense and even the concept of reality, yet 
        through these actions he acquires more and more power. He is an aasimar,
        that are extinct within the borders of Alir lost to their homeland of the Empire of Dawn. Upon escaping his former employers
        at Cirque Medrano Eliwel, under the alias Phil, joined a group of adventurers, to achieve his penumbral goals.
