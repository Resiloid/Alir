        Song of the dead, marching in unison through creation. Its rhythm drowning the voices of hope and despair.

                    Whenever you score a killing blow against a target, score a critical hit on an attack, or a target critically 
                    fails against a saving throw of yours that deals single target damage, your compulsion forces you to hum 
                    to the rhythm of the dead, until the end of your next turn. While humming the rhythm all damage dealt 
                    to you is delayed, until the humming ends. The damage after is dealt in a single blow, but cannot kill 
                    you.
