  <h1>Welcome to Alir, a world of absolute order, plagued by discord.
  </h1>
  <p class="important-paragraph">
    'Alir is just the name given to the mysterious tower in the middle of the world.
    Its grasping Cordons reaching towards the Scattered Realms of the material plane,
    like a glutton grabbing his last meal.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">
    (Yver the Forlorn mind, from his second tome of
    Comprehensive History of Alir)

  </p>

  <h2>The Geography</h2>
  <p>
    Alir is a colossal tower floating in the ether of the plane.
    Its impossible architecture connecting so called Realms, through the bridges named - the Cordons.
    These are the only terrestrial way to move through the planes making them into the trading routes and ways of
    conquest. The Realm whose cordons are severed, will forever float further away from the tower, eventually
    facing oblivion within the grey mists of the beyond.
  </p><br>
  <h2>The Realms of the Tower</h2>
  <p style="text-align: center;"><a class="world" href="#PoS">Planes of Serro</a>,
    <a class="world" href="#RotA">Respite of the Abandoned</a>,

      href="#RoI">
      Ruins of Iskar</a>, <a class="world" href="#ZF">Zeraxion Federation</a>)</p>
  <p>Numerous planes have been lost as their cordons crumbled, as they drifted into the mist. Two of planes lost in the
    millennia passed,
    drifting away into the grey mist are still barely accessible through the means of trans realm flight,
    although it is forbidden to bring refugees from the discarded realms. The creatures brought from the discared worlds
    are
    essentially dead men walking, feared and hated
    by practically everyone.
    The grey mist enveloping these realms deteriorates flesh and mind, giving almost prophetic visions to the
    afflicted pushing them closer and closer to insanity. Their skin growing sickly grey spots and their blood turning
    black and viscous as
    Tar. The ones touched by the mist will forever be known as the Forlorn, wandering the world plagued by the madness
    of the Infinite one.

      A lengthy structure filled with lush forests and peaceful gardens.
      Designed seemingly by a brilliant architect, its citizens are living in lavish palaces and surrounding feudal
      villiages.
      Each of the three major population centres is located under the watchful eye of the three Serpent matrons.
      Merciful Ocean, Wise Field, And Sorrowful Mountain.
      These serpents wrapping themselves around the realm their progeny living amongst their servants.
      The serpents are benevolent, although they bestow most of their gift on the Yuan-Ti their favored subjects.
      Thus usually the Yuan-ti occupy the highest spots in Serro society,
      2 out of 3 Shoguns of the land being of their species.
      The Dragonborn on the contrary are pushed to the fringes of society, as the progeny of Dragons,
      which the Serpents especially despise. The celestial serpents are rumored to be the three daughters of the
      progenitor serpent
      lost in untlod ages. Only her name is preserved in the eons - Gozuryu-Orochi.

      Races: Vampires, Dhampir, Undead, Refugee races. <br>

      Realm ruled by the cunning and charismatic Sire Lucious. His sired children occupying thw creme de la
      creme of the decadent society. His Realm welcomes all the banished and downtrodden.
      By his mercy you are saved, by his grace you are housed and by his wisdom you are given new purpose.
      Recently however one of the undead rabble quickly rose through the ranks surpassing even most Dukes and
      Dutchesses, to become the right hand man of Sire himself. His motives or goals unknown,
      only the name of this lich is not a secret – Swerza Blighted Touch.
      The Respites society is stringent in its hierarchy.
      Vampires being at the top – creatures living or dead who tasted the blood of the Sire, elevating
      their strength beyond mortal or undead capabilities.
      Dhampir are usually servants in Dukes and Dutchesses quarters,
      elevated by a blood of a vampire.
      And alas the downtrodden themselves, serving as a sizeable militia to the realm,
      in mere days quenching uprisings and in the past even able to hold the onslaught of the Dominion.
      One last thing of note is that Artificers are killed on sight in this realm, by the decree of Sire himself.
      What is strange, is that no retaliation followed this law, and the Artificers have forbade their kin from
      venturing into these lands.
      The realm is home to the Order of Sanguine Divines, built in the remains of a giant Vinegaroon,
      a remnant of the ancient heroic past of the realm and this religion.
      Underneath the skeleton of this monstrosity, supposedly felled in the days long past by the Founder
      of this Order, Archon Frederik the Ardent, is built an enormous teme complex. Now generations past,
      the Order is allied with the Sire, for its sole purpose of exterminating the Chorus throughout the realms.
      The Order is devoted to Lir a god of old, depicted in the main chapel by a statue of a muscular humanoid with
      lengthy claws and a Nonagram carved into its bare chest. Lir has three masks one in each hand and one on him. The
      statue in the Chapel has him dawn the Mask of Guile, an expression smiling deceitfully with its mouth bleeding.
      The one in the right hand is the mask of Power – an expression of Contempt on its eyes and a closed mouth, with
      bloodstains smeared on the sides of it. The last mask is the mask of Rage with an expression of utter bloodlust on
      it, with its eyes dripping with blood. Despite the menacing appearance, Lir is worshipped as the symbol of
      heroism, as he represents the Wit, Strength and Determination needed to protect the world.
      Wit gives your tongue the power to rake the enemy of life, your words poisoning the foe with uncertainty and
      infighting.
      Strength gives you the means to crush any, who menace the powerless. Their brawn dwarfed before your might.
      Determination is the courage to stand against the overwhelming atrocity, that faces all.
      These are the tenants of the Order, most acolytes subscribing to one of the three. Although some choose a
      more generalised path.
      It is said that by a blessing bestowed by the Archon, a willing and worthy soul can be cleansed and forged anew,
      said to cure even the forlorn and abominations of the chorus, who retained their free will.
      Currently the Order is headed by Archon Silas Drekfier, an imposing 10 feet tall human man in his late 40s,
      with a lengthy blonde beard, and a scar across his lip, known to occasionally open from stress.
      A Zealous, harsh yet formidable ruler, admired by all the paladins of the Order.

      The Crescent forest is a mysterious realm usually secluded from the outside world.
      The whole Realm being an enigmatic forest, where a stranger can lose both track and life.
      Its denizen playful and aloof pursuing arts and athletics, their bounty being the forests grace.
      Although devoid of any clear hierarchy, the forests denizen pray to the Elder Oak, the giant tree in the middle of
      the forest, said to be a protector of these lands. The land itself exists in two cycles, sun and moon, being the
      two
      secondary deities of the Elves. Their cults are shrouded in mystery as well considering that this world doesnt
      have a
      sun or a moon. Every year the cycle changes, as the plane itself switches towards(sun cycle) or away from the
      tower
      (moon cycle). This symbolizes everything, from changes in rituals to the change of the mood of the forest itself.
      The forests mood affects the mood of its denizen, appearing as a desire to play certain music, or even a desire to
      contemplate.
      The deizen, long forgot of war and strife within their cordons, the only militia being upkept is the
      Huners of the Eternal Twighlight, a group of creatures of all types, dedicating themselves to war as a form of
      art,
      honing their craft eternally in meditative practices and so called 'dances'.

      Deserts of Chur are a harsh land. Boiling in its heat, the sands spell doom to any who ignorantly venture here.
      The native denizen live in a constant struggle for resources.
      The Swarm of Kish’Il Led by its resourceful collective.
      They build illogical floating structures, made entirely out of biomass, named Flesh mergers.
      They are all telepathically connected to the hive, heat of the bodies of insects there, causing the desert to
      boil,
      looking like the red sun, mythologised by the elves.
      Siazh Duumvirate is a collective of two large hive cities both merged into one by one of the twin emperors of
      Siazh.
      The cities are built in so called sand sinkholes, vortexes of sand dropping from the holes within the realm.
      Within these holes the geometrical structures are built as layers. Until the bottom layer housing the
      palaces of the emperors. A caste society, the life of the child is determined at the start of puberty, as decreed
      by the temples of the great desert, and Dark father.
      Some humans have settled around the Oasises, their setllements becoming the point of connection to this realm.
      The biggest one by far being Taovar, a large town at Realms borders with the tower. The towns council is chosen
      democratically, making Taovar a republic-city-state. Current Ruler Marimid Id’Bala, is beloved by the people.

      Kingdom of the chosen is a paradox even for most scholars, the ruler of this place is Fa’Adal,
      an Artificer, creatures usually not known to live outside the tower. The relatively small realm is in the perfect
      peace, while the citizenry is worshipping what they call the sacred symmetry. With the knowledge of an artificer
      the Realm was reshaped into a perfect spiral, at the bottom of it lying the citadel of shapes,
      of where Adal resides. The realm almost never gets visits from the Artificers, but their rare comings are treated
      as a holiday,
      usually with an invitation to a party in the citadel.
      The Vedalken, native to this realm before the coming of Fa’Adal, are reverent of him, calling him the shaper.
      In their old tales seemingly overnight Adal has reshaped the realm into the perfect spiral, and in the same vein
      granted the citizenry a purpose.
      Every year two events take place within the spiral. The Erection, which adds another outer layer to the spiral.
      And the Valuation games which gives devout outsiders a chance to become citizen of the great kingdom. Both are led
      by the
      Shaper, and by his will the realm moves on.

      The Asteri Dominion is all that is left of the Asteri empire,
      (most of its territories drifting away , now named the Forlorn empire of Dawn.)
      Ruled by the Emperor Tesorus the Bloodied, who claims to be a direct descendant of the Yrail bloodline,
      the tyrannical rulers of the empire. The dominion is in a disarray, with disobediemt lords of provinces and the
      sizeable population
      of halflings inspired by the tales of their free past plotting a rebellion. This prompts the Emperor to more
      drastic and cruel measures
      , lynchings, public executions and extrajudicial showings of force. The other aspect of the Empire’s rule is the
      utter contempt to the
      artificers. Although killing them is prohibited, the Artficers are looked upon with fear and hatred and rarely can
      get any help from
      locals. The dominion calls the false prophets, and worships their own pantheon of divine beings with Aol, the Dawn
      being the main deity.
      So far the Asteri Dominion has shown itself to have ambitions of conquest, its armies gathered on the cordons,
      supported by
      mysterious allies
      from the mist, and their advanced weaponry. Tesorus has promised its fervent human populus a conquest
      premonitioned by the Empire of
      Dawn. With assistance from its Three pillars -
      Esteemed Advisory Ragnar Ilray, Star Ambassador Hrothir Gigafunk and the Supreme General Garnar Kurin,
      his aspirations are driven to reality.

      The tenuous relationships between the lords of the empire, after the empires collapse has led Minius the Wise to
      reject the claim to the throne of Tesorus. Minius calls himself the spiritual successor of the ancient settlers of
      the Dominion,
      whose teachings were perverted by the emperors of old professing full isolationism and crushing the rebelling
      nobility with his army,
      by freeing the Aaracockra slaves and equating their rights with the ones of the humans. Now the Spires are
      inhabited by the loyal of
      Minius, while the deposed lords have been exiled to the pits, where they scramble for the smallest bits of power
      they can find.
      The people of this Dominion worship the artificers as the angelic messengers of the One God, decrying the old
      polytheistic beliefs as
      barbaric. The relations between the Aaracockra and Kenku meanwhile were also at a boiling point. While the Bright
      ones, as the aaracockra
      call themselves, were living in luxury, their Dark brethren slaved and toiled at the margins of society, treated
      simultaneously as working mules
      and as children, unable to make own descisions. This prompted the Kenku to seek refuge in the ruins of their once
      mighty kingdom
      where a Dark king perched upon a crumbling throne was seeking redemption and retribution, while allying himself
      with the power, that
      some would see as monstrous - The Chorus. These machinations were gathering corpses, to be used as meat, to stitch
      upon the body of the
      long dead god of the Kenku. Only an unknown band of adventurers, that those who claim to have witnessed call the
      'Kings Court' have broken
      the hold of the dark power upon the Kenku, and defeated the Dark King, thwarting his designs forever, and dooming
      the Kenku to flightlessness.

      A Whimsical realm of princesses and dragons, formerly known as Rakdun, is ruled by the benevolent Kazzruk.
      He has elevated the realm one millenia ago, from a wartorn landscape into a world of beauty and piece.
      Of course strife still exists within the realm, but there are always mighty heroes to stop the dragon and save the
      princess.
      There are three kingdoms within the realm, Flower Kingdom, with its capital of Kazzar, Gnomopolis and the
      Mountains of Azed’dum.
      Many seek refuge from war and oppression here and the benevolent Kazzruk obliges, after all, the world always
      needs more heroes,
      and who knows how useful YOU are going to be?
      <br>However, unrest has swept through the Realm, as a long lost brother of Kazzruk named Hamuk the Wise has
      returned, while presumed
      to be dead. He overtook the largest trading city of Leo, where he docily resides. There go rumors of King Kazzruks
      life being in jeopardy, although
      those are just speculations. Finally, a strange incident occured, which has made an Ambassadory of the Kingdom of
      the chosen dissappear
      under mysterious circumstances. These movements threaten to shake the established order of the Kingdom - prompting
      its denizen to flee
      to the neighboring realms.

      empty passways, or oblivion.
      None who strayed from the beaten path have returned, and none who have recovered a moticum of information about
      its elusive denizen
      have lived to tell the tale.

      Enlighted city is the epicentre of knowledge in the realm, filled with libraries and markets offering a selection
      of valuables for your
      perusal. Once the crown jewel of Iskar, the city now is a dire reminder of the death of its progenitor.
      The city houses a sizeable population of scaled creatures from lizardfolk to dragons, who nest on top of the
      spires,
      leisurely pursuing riches and wisdom.
      The city is ruled by the triumvirate, which has full authority over it. Each member is appointed by the respected
      guild.
      The Brokers guild, The Scholars Socium and the House of Crafters.
      They approve any research done in the city, and unauthorized pursuit of knowledge is punishable by exile.
      The entire realm is a city, its golden spires enchanting even the ones with the most sophisticated tastes, while
      the darker reaches of its ghettos
      choke its denizen with smog and crime. A place of commerce, the citizen of this realm have elevated barter and
      enrichment to the
      pinnacles of virtue.

      Not much is known of the remnants of the empire lost 600 years ago.
      The few accounts declare a lawless wasteland ruled by warlords.
      The groups are fighting over the resources near the corpse of Aol, the former god of the empire.
      Its corpse guarded by the devout who drank his blood under the rule of Fathom the Haloed. Recently a ship of
      slavers has left
      the borders of this realm carrying on board precious cargo. Cargo that will change the world forever.

      The Ruins of Iskar are a barren wasteland of a once bustling city.
      Now fully engulfed with the mist once proud people shamble here aimlessly, their mind torn with visions from
      beyond and their flesh
      rotten. The Lost, as they are called no longer resemble themselves their murmurings breaking reality around
      themselves in grotesque mockery of life
      . And the few ones who manage to escape it find themselves unable to heal
      from the mists influence, left with nothing, but an inevitability of insanity.
