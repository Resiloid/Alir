        Preposterous! I hear myself ordering an investigation, giving my word, a royal word. I hear Jesters 
        voice.... he will help. <br>
        I see.... circles of Asha, as the critter descends to in...vest..igate...
        I see dirt, feel the stench, hear cries of uneducated masses. Politics.... They are.... mortal pursuits....Grey 
        robes.... poverty.<br>
        The critter... came back.... found a culprit... He ascends.... <br>
        I see the traitor before me... Myself royal, divine. There stands Astaroth. Chased away by my royal 
        ...decree...<br>
        The critter did good, but betrayed me. I see dragon breath leaving my maw. Two piles of ash before 
        me...<br>
        I hear Jesters voice.... He says that he will find culprits.... He needs an army....
        Why are bones of my siblings here?.... In Asha...?<br>
        Will Jester save Asha... Will I?

     premonitions of insanity and premonitions of delusion thus far. This lasts until the end of your next turn.
