You have taken on a responsibility for maintenance of the Life in the realm of the Spires of the 
Dominion. The more your connection with nature grows, the more your mind dissolves in the collective.<br>
((Passive))<br>
Myxellal overgrowth<br>
Each time you use an ability on this list, you grow your connection to life itself, increasing your 
maximum health by 1d10-7. For every subsequent use of these abilities the health increase is increased 
by 10 (1d10+3→ 1d10+13 and so on)<br>
Once this bonus reaches 150 Health you connect with the nature fully, losing any form of individuality. 
If you die with this power, you can sacrifice the godhood, to survive, this however will end most life in 
the Spires of the dominion, and will severely weaken all creatures connected to nature. <br>
Abilities <br>
1)Myconid Minions<br>
You summon a Myconid minion that sprouts out of your body. Its a small humanoid with all stats equal 
10, evasion and 1 HP. There are 4 types of minions to summon. They have their turn before you on the 
initiative order. <br>
1.Zapper Myconid <br>
Uses its action to cast chain lightning with spell save DC equal to yours. <br>
2. Dapper Myconid<br>
While alive this Myconid oozes confidence giving allies automatic success on any first wisdom saving 
throw they have to make. If the target takes damage, Dapper Myconid can help them again. <br>
3. Proper Myconid<br>
Channels a heal at the designated target as an action, healing them to full health. Can switch targets 
once as a reaction, immediately healing the target to full HP. <br>
4. Sapper Myconid<br>
At the start of his turn rushes at the enemy, forcing them to make a DC 21 dex save or suffer 15d10 fire 
damage +1d10 damage multiplied by the difference between the number rolled and the DC.<br>
2) Grove overgrowth<br>
Creates a 100 feet area around you overgrown with mushrooms and plants. Anyone you designate in 
this area has all the damage they take reduced by your level while they remain inside, and you can freely 
teleport in this area as a bonus action. <br>
3) Spore of destruction<br>
You force the target to make a DC 21 constitution saving throw. Upon fail the spore embeds itself 
comfortably in the targets body dealing 1d10 damage at the start of the targets turn. Each subsequent 
instance of damage is doubled. They can make a save at the end of their turn, ending the effect. Upon 
failing the save the damage is doubled as well. <br>
4) Fruits of the Harvest <br>
You sprout branches out of your body, ripened with fruit. You imbue them with a spell of your choosing 
by casting it into the fruit. The number of fruit is equal to 1d6+ your proficiency bonus. Creature that 
consumes the fruit can use the embedded spell at will without expending resources until you use any 
ability from the power of this god again. <br>
Fruits taste may wary, and the creatures that consume the fruit will lose the ability to swim or even stay 
afloat in salt water.
