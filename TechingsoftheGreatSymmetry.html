     The sacred shapes form within the battlefield, but a master Welder is able to seize the moment ripping it from the continuity of a whole. 
     Thusly they create a non-essence, which distorts the divine symmetry into another, changing the very existence around it.

     Weld Symmetry 
                </summary> 
                As an action, you can weld a shape on the battlefield. Pick up to (2+the tier of this frature) targets, 
                forcing them to make a Strength save, against your spell save DC. On fail the targets speed is reduced to 
                0. <br>
                They can repeat the save at the end of their turn. You can dismiss the effect on the target with a free 
                action/free reaction.

        If the shape of the Welded symmetry is perfect, you will get a backlash, energizing you with vigor 
        depending on the amount of target Welded within. (F.e. Triangle with equal sides)<br>
        If the symmetry is perfect, you gain amount of spell slot levels equal to twice the number of the targets 
        welded. Per each target welded you gain max HP equal to your level, and the boon of that symmetry 
        until the next long rest.

    Chapter 4 
    Response to Dar’Karpatals proposal on mortality
    Infinitely complex creation, while flawed is rife for exploration. Its complexities stemmed from 
    uncertainty of own existence, like a religion of the cycle, with which we are personally acquainted, and 
    thus not mystified by it. Posits Dar’Karpatal in his treatise on the nature of mortality. <br>
    My proposition however, is as follows. Their existence itself is purposed to uncertainty, like the building 
    blocks of nature and magic are impurified by the creation to have a core of unpredictable instability. 
    As posited by my Creator, Elder Oh’rom – “These creatures, while inferior are in their essence opposite 
    to my siblings and my creations. My attempts at fabricating their freedom was only half successful. 
    Freedom can be algorithmic and even covered in the mind of the creation, but it will always stay 
    ultimately predictable. Mortals however while not lacking predictability according to my current 
    research absolutely lack algorithmicity of existence.”<br>
    Excerpt from “Nature of mortality, and its place in the purpose” by Fa’Adal.

            Adaptation within the purpose
     </summary> 
     Question usually arises during my sermons – “How much do we need to act within the purpose? Could 
     we not lose the path for a fake one? And I always answer, that the purpose guides you from within, 
     granting you divine insights towards the right path. And sometimes you might think that you are forcing 
     destiny, meanwhile it is just according to your purpose.” 
     One of Fa’Adal’s sermons before shaping a new ring in the kingdom of the chosen.
