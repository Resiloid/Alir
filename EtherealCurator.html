           Soul Invocation</summary>
        <p class="TherakirAbilities">To invoke one of your souls, you need to use a bonus action. You can only have a number of souls 
          invoked equal to your level /4 rounded down. To dismiss a soul you need to use a bonus action. </p>

        <p class="TherakirAbilities">Therakirs powers allow him to manipulate souls to his bidding. There are three modes of engagement. <br>
          1)Compel Soul<br>
          If you compel the soul of a dead, by successfully persuading them, you gain partial insights in their 
          experiences. When the compelled soul is invoked you gain a small bonus depending on the nature of the 
          soul. <br>
          2)Subjugate Soul<br>
          Powerful, defiant or hostile souls will require subjugation. If an unworthy soul is attempted to be 
          subjugated it is shattered, the essence seeping into you. To Subjugate a worthy Soul Therakir has to let 
          the spirit within his own body whereas his soul will fight the other. Upon victory the Soul is subjugated, 
          upon loss you roll a D100. On a roll of 1-3 the soul takes over your body, subjugating your spirit. 
          Therakirs spirit will need to look for his own freedom. On a roll of 3-100 the soul leaves your body and is 
          forever beyond reach. When invoked, Subjugated souls grant a powerful ability. <br>
          3) Shattered Souls<br>
          (1 minute ritual)<br>
          Mercilessly you can decide to shatter a soul, destroying its being and absorbing its essence. Unworthy 
          souls allow you to use your hit die. Worthy Souls grant permanent small bonuses to Therakir s stats 
          without the need of invocation.  </p>

        Eons ago were still a clear memory for Tiber, born into the lap of luxury in a kingdom, the name of which 
        was long forgotten by time and himself. His ambitions however were further than anything his nobility 
        promised. Young boy craved knowledge above all else. He quickly devoured everything in his fathers 
        study, soon being sent to an Arcane Collegium. Unfortunately talentless in the ethereal arts, he did pick 
        up some abilities, that he would use for practical purposes. But reading everything the Collegium had to 
        offer still didn’t numb the craving for more. <br>
        A chance meeting, tall and pale figure, and a slender researcher on his knees in front of the titan. A 
        flowing torrent, feeding his cravings, granting Immortality and a chance to find omniscience in eternity. 
        And only for a little cost of the taste of the bloodline...<br>
        Upon invocation Lord Merville grants you insights into his techniques, granting you +1 to Intelligence, 
        Wisdom and charisma score every hour stacking up to 5 times. Upon dismissal the bonus is lost.

   However her aesthetic fascination with domination would only bring her dissapointment, as her Husbands position as a 
   diplomatic envoy to the city of Leo was covert. At this time, Gia sought out the Sire of the Respite of the Abandoned, 
   enamoured with the image of opulent decadence of the crimson society. 
   Converted by Lady Eva 'the Slumber Shape' Ornestie in the next month, and feeding her 
   own blood to her three sons, she slaughtered her husband, and took over the mansion, as an agent of the Sire. <br>
   When invoked, you gain a bonus action attack that latches you to the opponent, making you move with the latched target. 
Deals 1d4 necrotic damage, and as long as you are latched to it the damage increases by 1d4, and if you are already latched,
 you hit with this attack automatically. All damage dealt with this ability restores your HP.

  Soul of the Draconic Progenitor

</h5>

<p 
class="TherakirAbilities" style="margin: 0">


Arok the Allmighty, he is mine, his voice quieter than mine... For now.<br>
Passive<br>
Voice of the Almighty<br>
You can speak with the voice of Arok. To switch you need to use an action. When you are, ALL creatures 
moving in your direction are slowed by 10 feet. Your voice is heard within 1 mile this way. Your whisper 
– 100 meters. <br>
Strength of the Almighty<br>
Your life force is infused with the vitality and power of the Progentor. You gain extra 3 HP per player 
level. Your damage dealt is permanently increased by your level. <br>
Pride of the Almighty<br>
Arok is never truly subjugated, never enslaved. He will forever be a power within you, seeking to 
consume the individual. <br>
Every time you use non-passive abilities from the “soul of the draconic progenitor” you roll a d100. If 
you roll below 1, Arok will overtake your essence for the number of days equal to your level, then you 
can attempt to take control back from him at the start of every day with a single wisdom check of 20, 
upon a failed attempt the DC is increased by 2. Every subsequent use of the abilities before the long 
rest increases this DC by 12. Once Arok overtakes you 3 times, your own essence dissolves within his 
greatness, no saves possible. Upon a long rest the DC is decreased by 3. <br>
Abilities<br>
1)Draconic Hubris <br>
(Action)<br>
Arok can match armies blow for blow, effortlessly sweeping nations off the map. You force every 
creature of your choice within 100 feet to make a Wis 24 saving throw. On fail the targets are forced to 
attack you for 10 minutes, and per every creature that fails you gain 50 temp HP (stacking). At the end of 
their turn, the affected creatures can repeat the saving throw (with advantage if dealt damage by 
anyone but your character), if all of them succeed, your temporary HP is removed. <br>
2) Draconic Justice<br>
(Reaction)<br>
When someone dares to impact the progenitor, they will be met with horrifying retribution. 
If you have been slighted by an attack of an enemy, you can use your reaction to make a single melee 
attack with your weapon. If you hit you deal damage in number of d4s equal to half the damage you 
received. <br>
3) Draconic Atrocity<br>
(Action)<br>
The ones beneath you are less than toys to be broken. Less than bugs to be squished. Less than a speck 
of dust compared to your greatness. 
You charge up your chromatic breath. At the end of your next turn you will fire a 3 mile long cone of a 
chosen element. The affected creatures need to make a DC 24 dex save. On fail they take a number of 
d6 in damage of that element equal to 20 times your level. <br>
4) Draconic Vitality<br>
(Action)<br>
Your life-force is incomprehensible, immeasurable, monstrous. If they dare to strike you, you will come 
back at these critters with power to show futility of their actions. 
You double your Max HP, and restore yourself to max HP. <br>
5) Draconic Tyranny <br>
(Action)<br>
It is not tyranny to stand above those born to be crushed and serve beneath your feet. 
You unleash a crippling roar around you that instantly kills all creatures of your choice within 1 mile with 
current health equal or lower than thrice your player level.
